Command Line Tools and Redirections
This repository includes a collection of files and examples demonstrating the usage of various command line tools and redirection techniques. These tools are commonly used in Unix-like systems to manipulate and process data efficiently.

Commands
head: The head command is used to display the first few lines of a file or input. It helps you quickly view the beginning of a file without loading the entire contents.

tail: The tail command is similar to head, but it displays the last few lines of a file or input. It is useful for viewing the end of log files or monitoring real-time updates.

find: The find command allows you to search for files and directories in a specified location and its subdirectories. You can search based on criteria such as file name, size, or modification time.

wc: The wc command stands for "word count." It helps you count the number of lines, words, and characters in a file or input. This is particularly useful when analyzing text data.

sort: The sort command is used to sort lines of text in a file or input. You can specify whether to sort in ascending or descending order, and you can also sort based on numeric or alphabetical values.

uniq: The uniq command filters out duplicate lines from a sorted file or input. It displays only unique lines and can also count the number of occurrences of each line.

grep: The grep command is a powerful text search tool. It allows you to find lines that match a specific pattern or regular expression in a file or input.

tr: The tr command is used for character-level translation or deletion. It helps you replace or delete specific characters in a file or input.

Redirections
Redirecting Standard Output: You can redirect the standard output of a command to a file using the > symbol. For example, command > file.txt saves the output of command to file.txt.

Redirecting Standard Input: You can provide input to a command from a file instead of the keyboard using the < symbol. For example, command < file.txt takes input from file.txt.

Piping Output: You can send the output of one command as input to another command using the | symbol. For example, command1 | command2 passes the output of command1 to command2.

Combining Commands with Redirections: You can combine multiple commands and filters with redirections to create powerful data processing pipelines. For example, command1 | command2 > file.txt takes the output of command1, passes it to command2, and saves the final output to file.txt.

Feel free to explore the files in this repository to see practical examples of how these commands and redirections can be used. Have fun learning and experimenting with the command line tools!
